# Neural-Network

With my assiduousness in gaining knowledge, i decided to explore a new technology, TensorFlow with Python had already caught my attention, here I share with you a small project using TensorFlow, which is an opensource library for machine learning applications.



This project makes use of a neural network to classify images, I have in production, 10 categories of images, among them: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. My algorithm makes use of more than 10,000 images in the learning process, in this way, through modern methods of bit classification, it manages to return a satisfactory result for reality. This algorithm is on the official website of the platform, it was used by a curious person to study the technology in depth!
